# A python based GUI calculator for desktop environments 
## simple_calc

WELCOME

The simple_calc was developed in python with the help of ktinker package.
Which takes care of all the GUI elements/widgets and python being a very 
user friendly language, enabled in fast creation...

You can download the three different versions of the calc, Calc3 is the final one,
I've added the other two older ones for your reference. (Install ktinker package before trying to execute the code)
